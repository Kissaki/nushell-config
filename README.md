# Nushell Configuration

My personal [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) configuration, integration, and scripts.

## Setup

Expected to be checked out to `~/nushell` and integrated as described in env.nu and config.nu

## Requirements / Expectations

* Installed [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
* Checked out [nu_scripts](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/) (community scripts)

### nu_scripts

nu_scripts checkout to `nu_scripts`

```git
git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts.git nu_scripts
```
